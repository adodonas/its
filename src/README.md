As part of our master's degree study, we conducted a project titled "Assessing the COVID-19 Impact on Air Quality in Israel: A Machine Learning Approach." In this project, we were inspired by a published study that explored a similar topic. Many research initiatives worldwide have examined the effects of the lockdown measures implemented in 2020 due to the Corona Virus disease on air quality. Although these initiatives generally agree on the reduction of pollution, there is an ongoing debate about the most reliable method for quantifying pollution reduction.

In our study, we utilized machine learning models based on the Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm to evaluate the impact of the outbreak on air quality in different districts of Israel. Initially, we assessed the accuracy of our predictions by using cross-validation on the five-year period before the lockdown.

Subsequently, we quantified the changes in pollution levels during the lockdown period. Our analysis revealed that districts with heavy traffic experienced the most significant reduction in pollution. As restrictions were partially lifted, pollution concentrations began to return to levels similar to those observed before the pandemic. We supported our assessment of the pollution drop by evaluating the confidence of our predictions.

Through our project, our aim was to contribute to the understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected air quality in Israel. By employing machine learning techniques, we provided valuable insights into pollution patterns and changes during the lockdown period. Our findings underscore the importance of implementing effective measures to reduce pollution, particularly in areas with high traffic volumes. Furthermore, our study highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms in analyzing and predicting the dynamics of air quality during unprecedented events like a pandemic.
