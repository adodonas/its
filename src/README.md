In the course of our postgraduate pursuit, we undertook a project labelled "Evaluating the COVID-19 Influence on Air Quality in Israel: A Machine Learning Perspective." The inspiration for this project was derived from a previously published investigation that delved into a related subject. Numerous research undertakings globally have probed into the consequences of the lockdown measures enforced in 2020 due to the outbreak of the Corona Virus disease on air quality. Although a common consensus is reached on the diminution of pollution, there persists a dispute over the most dependable methodology for gauging the reduction in pollution.

In our research, we employed machine learning models built on the Gradient Boosting Machine algorithm to measure the impact of the pandemic on the quality of air in various districts of Israel. We initially validated the precision of our forecasts by performing cross-validation over the five-year span preceding the lockdown.

Following this, we quantified the shifts in pollution levels during the period of the lockdown. Our scrutiny divulged that districts with high vehicular congestion registered the most dramatic decrease in pollution. As the restrictions were partially revoked, the pollution concentrations started reverting to pre-pandemic figures. We buttressed our estimation of the fall in pollution by evaluating the confidence of our predictions.

Our objective through this project was to augment the understanding of how the COVID-19 pandemic has influenced the quality of air in Israel. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we offered valuable insights into the patterns and shifts of pollution during the lockdown phase. Our deductions underscore the significance of executing efficient strategies to curb pollution, especially in regions with heavy traffic. Moreover, our research accentuates the potential of machine learning algorithms in analysing and forecasting the dynamics of air quality amid unprecedented occurrences such as a pandemic.
