# Analysis
This report presents a statistical analysis comparing Nitric Oxide (NO) levels during lockdowns and Jewish holidays.

## Hypothesis
In scientific research, a hypothesis is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For this analysis, the hypothesis is that the average NO levels are significantly different during lockdowns and Jewish holidays.

This is considered as the alternative hypothesis (H1). On the contrary, the null hypothesis (H0) is that there is no significant difference in the average NO levels during lockdowns and Jewish holidays. The null hypothesis assumes that any kind of difference or importance you see in your data is due to chance.

The p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, which suggests that the NO levels during lockdowns and Jewish holidays are  significantly different.

## Mean NO levels
The following are the average NO levels during the two different periods:
During lockdown: 0.01397960613636071, During Jewish holidays: 0.015781527038698666

## Conclusion
The p-value was 0.0031099248339707766. This p-value is used to determine the statistical significance of our results. The p-value is a measure of the probability that an observed difference could have occurred just by random chance.

A lower p-value suggests that the observed data are less likely to occur under the null hypothesis. Therefore, a p-value less than or equal to 0.05 is often used as a cut-off for rejecting the null hypothesis. In other words, if the p-value is less than or equal to 0.05, we consider the results statistically significant, and we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

If the p-value is greater than 0.05, we consider the results not statistically significant, and we do not reject the null hypothesis. This means that the observed difference in NO levels could have occurred by chance, and there is no evidence to suggest that the NO levels are significantly different during lockdowns and Jewish holidays.

Interpretation of this result is left as an exercise for the reader.
